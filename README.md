# Thymio-Robot-Programming
This report presents the collaborative effort of a team of four, including myself, in programming a Thymio robot for competitive challenges against other class-built robots on intricate tracks. Our project culminated in a successful demonstration of the robot's capabilities, securing first place in the race and earning an A+ grade for the project.
